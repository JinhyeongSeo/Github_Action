                            Project Leyden Ships Third Option for Faster Application Start with JEP 483 in Java 24
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com//news/2025/03/java-24-leyden-ships/?topicPageSponsorship=dc012f8e-5f47-403e-9080-25e96ea89f69
설명 : 
                         In Java 24, Project Leyden’s JEP 483, "Ahead-of-Time Class Loading & Linking", starts Java applications like Spring PetClinic up to 40% faster without code changes or new application constraints. It needs a training run to build a cache file that ships with the application. With GraalVM Native Image and CRaC, the startup is 95-99% faster but faces more constraints. Leyden plans more improvements.

                            Learnings from Working with Programming Rules and Guidelines
                        
주소 : https://www.infoq.com//news/2025/03/learnings-programming-rules/?topicPageSponsorship=dc012f8e-5f47-403e-9080-25e96ea89f69
설명 : 
                         Programming rules and guidelines improve code consistency, but misapplication can lead to poor results. Arne Mertz suggests that software developers selectively adopt rules and guidelines, and document deviations with clear explanations. They can discuss their experiences in communities or during their daily work, to foster collaboration and improve code quality without unnecessary bureaucracy.
